# Network Programming with BSD Sockets
A demonstration of network programming in C using sockets

## showip.c
This code demonstrates the retrieval of a host machine's IP address. The code needs to be supplied with a hostname or IP (e.g., localhost, www.google.com, or 127.0.0.1).

## client.c and server.c
Is the normal client-server architecture that is using the connection oriented protocol (TCP).

## talker.c and listener.c
This demonstrates **connection-less communication**, where the sender (talker) does not need to know if the receiver (listener) is up and running. It uses a "fire-and-forget" approach with **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**.

In this model:

- The talker sends a message without establishing a connection with the listener.
- If the listener is running at the time the message is transmitted, it will receive the message.
- If the listener is not available, the message will be lost.
- The talker does not care whether the message is received, as there is no feedback mechanism or guarantee of delivery in UDP.

## poll.c, pollserver.c, select.c, and selectserver.c
These demonstrates how to achieve **non-blocking socket I/O** using the `poll()` and `select()` system calls in C. The examples provided show both proof-of-concept code and real-world applications of these APIs.
The primary goal of these examples is to illustrate how to handle multiple file descriptors (e.g., sockets) without blocking the program while waiting for data. By using either `poll()` or `select()`, the program can monitor multiple connections and perform other operations concurrently.
1. **poll.c**  
   Proof of concept demonstrating the behavior of the `poll()` system call. This example shows how to use `poll()` to monitor multiple file descriptors for readability, writability, or errors.
2. **select.c**  
   Proof of concept demonstrating the behavior of the `select()` system call. This example showcases how `select()` works to monitor a set of file descriptors for various events.
3. **pollserver.c**  
   A server implementation using the `poll()` API to manage multiple client connections in a non-blocking manner. This demonstrates how `poll()` can be used in real-world applications to efficiently handle I/O on many sockets.
4. **selectserver.c**  
   A server implementation using the `select()` API to manage multiple client connections. This shows how `select()` can be applied in a practical server application to handle multiple sockets without blocking.

## broadcast.c
This demonstrates the transmission of broadcast messages to the entire network nodes.
The Principle of Operation of this code is as follows:
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** is used to send broadcast messages. UDP is a connection-less protocol, making it suitable for sending messages to multiple devices simultaneously without establishing individual connections.
  
- **Broadcasting to a subnet**: Send the data to a specific subnetâ€™s broadcast address. For example, if the network address is `192.168.1.0` and the subnet mask is `255.255.255.0`, the broadcast address is `192.168.1.255`.

- **Global broadcast**: Alternatively, you can send the data to the **global broadcast address** `255.255.255.255`, which will broadcast the message to all reachable nodes on the network.

- **Firewall considerations**: Ensure that the firewall on your local machine is not blocking UDP broadcast packets. If the firewall is configured to block UDP traffic, the broadcast messages will not be delivered to the network.
